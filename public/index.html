            <div id="output" class="screen glowing-text">You find yourself standing on a cold, damp floor, surrounded by the rough-hewn stone walls that make up this dismal dungeon cell. A sturdy wooden door is set into the north wall, its surface worn smooth in places. In the south east corner of the room, a wooden bedframe stands against the wall, with a straw mattress on top of it. On the floor nearby, you see a small wooden table holding a single candle that hasn't been lit yet. A pool of foul-smelling water occupies the south west corner of the cell.
You have a small leather satchel slung over your shoulder, which contains a flint and steel set. What would you like to do?</div>
